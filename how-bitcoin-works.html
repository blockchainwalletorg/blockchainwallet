<h1>How does Bitcoin work?</h1>

<p>As a new user, you can get started with Bitcoin without understanding the technical details. Once you've <a href="https://blockchainwallet.org/">installed a Bitcoin wallet</a> on your computer or mobile phone, it will generate your first Bitcoin address and you can create more whenever you need one. You can disclose your addresses to your friends so that they can pay you or vice versa. In fact, this is pretty similar to how email works, except that Bitcoin addresses should be used only once. When you're ready, you can <a href="https://bch.gg/buy">buy your first Bitcoin</a> and send it directly to your wallet.</p>
  
<p>The blockchain is a shared global public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the blockchain. It allows Bitcoin wallets to calculate their spendable balance so that new transactions can be verified thereby ensuring they're actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the blockchain are enforced with cryptography.</p> 

<p>Mining is a distributed consensus system that is used to confirm pending transactions by including them in the blockchain. It enforces a chronological order in the blockchain, protects the neutrality of the network, and allows different computers to agree on the state of the system. To be confirmed, transactions must be added to a block that fits strict cryptographic rules that will be verified by the network. These rules prevent previous blocks from being modified because doing so would invalidate all the subsequent blocks. Mining also creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that prevents any individual from easily adding new blocks consecutively to the blockchain. In this way, no group or individuals can control what is included in the blockchain or replace parts of the blockchain to roll back their own transactions.</p>

<p>This is just a short summary of Bitcoin. If you want to learn more of the details of how it works, <a href="https://blockchainwallet.org/bitcoin.pdf">you can read the original Bitcoin whitepaper that describes its design</a>.</p>
	
<center><h2>How to stay safe using Bitcoin</h2></center>
	
<p><strong>Secure your wallet.</strong> First step is to backup your wallet and keep your backup phrase/seed offline in case you ever need to access your Bitcoin from another location or wallet. Use small amounts in your hot wallet and keep your savings in offline wallets that aren't connected to the internet. Make sure access to your wallet is encrypted with a long randomly generated password. Always make sure any software you use is kept up to date and that you are using sufficient virus and malware protection on your computer.</p>
	
<p><strong>The Bitcoin price is volatile.</strong> The price of a Bitcoin can unpredictably increase or decrease over short periods of time due to its maturing economy and growing markets. Bitcoin should be seen as a high risk asset and you should never store money that you cannot afford to lose with Bitcoin. If you receive payments with Bitcoin, many service providers can convert them to your local currency.</p>
	
<p><strong>Bitcoin payments are irreversible.</strong> A Bitcoin transaction cannot be reversed, it can only be refunded by the person receiving the funds, just like how cash money is used traditionally. This means you should take care to do business with people and organizations you know and trust or who have an established reputation. For their part, businesses need to keep track of the payment requests they are displaying to their customers. Bitcoin can detect typos and usually won't let you send money to an invalid address by mistake, but it's best to have controls in place for additional safety and redundancy. Additional services exist to provide more choice and protection for both businesses and consumers.</p>
	
<p><strong>Bitcoin is still experimental.</strong> Bitcoin is an experimental new currency that is in active development. Each improvement makes Bitcoin more appealing but also reveals new challenges as Bitcoin adoption grows. Be prepared for issues and consult the Bitcoin community before making any investments so that you can hear from others and their experiences first. Remember that past performance is not always indicative of future results.</p>
