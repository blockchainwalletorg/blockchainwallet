<h1>Getting Started with Bitcoin & Blockchain</h1>

<p>Bitcoin operates with no central authority like a government or financial institution. Managing transactions and the issuing of Bitcoin is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source code, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and anyone anywhere in the world can participate in it. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows for exciting new use cases that could not be covered by any previous payments system.</p>
  
<p>Bitcoin is different than what you know and use every day like with credit cards and the traditional banking system. Bitcoin has several unique attributes such as fast peer-to-peer transactions, it is uncensorable, it allows for borderless payments and has cheap processing fees with no middle man. Some key properties of Bitcoin is that it has a limited supply, it's decentralized, it's anonymous and it has an immutable (irreversible) global ledger called the blockchain.</p>
  
<p>Ready to get started? Follow these 3 easy steps below to begin using Bitcoin!</p>

<h2>Step 1: Buy your first Bitcoin</h2>

<p>The first step to participating is to buy your first Bitcoin. Don’t worry, you don’t have to buy a whole Bitcoin, as it can be denominated into smaller units, such as buying half or a quarter of a Bitcoin. You can buy as much or as little as you want. After you buy Bitcoin, you will want to store it in a Bitcoin wallet.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Store your Bitcoin in a wallet</h2>

<p>Using a Bitcoin wallet where you control your money is one of the most important steps to securing your cryptocurrency. Not just any wallet will do. All online wallets are susceptible to hackers and malware, so the best way to store your Bitcoin is using an offline hardware wallet. This is also called keeping your Bitcoin in "cold storage". This protects your money with the highest level of security without sacrificing convenience. It is the safest and most popular wallet for storing cryptocurrencies.</p>
