<h1>Getting Started with Bitcoin & Blockchain</h1>

<p>Bitcoin operates with no central authority like a government or financial institution. Managing transactions and the issuing of Bitcoin is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source code, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and anyone anywhere in the world can participate in it. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows for exciting new use cases that could not be covered by any previous payments system - <a href="/how-bitcoin-works.html">read more about how Bitcoin works</a>.</p>
  
<p>Bitcoin is different than what you know and use every day like with credit cards and the traditional banking system. Bitcoin has several unique attributes such as fast peer-to-peer transactions, it is uncensorable, it allows for borderless payments and has cheap processing fees with no middle man. Some key properties of Bitcoin is that it has a limited supply, it's decentralized, it's anonymous and it has an immutable (irreversible) global ledger called the blockchain.</p>
