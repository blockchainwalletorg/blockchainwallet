<h1>Getting Started with Bitcoin & Blockchain</h1>

Bitcoin operates with no central authority; managing transactions and the issuing of Bitcoin is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can participate. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows for exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system. Ready to get started? Follow the easy steps below to begin! 

<h2>Step 1: Buy your first Bitcoin</h2>

The first step to participating is to buy your first Bitcoin. Don’t worry, you don’t have to buy a whole Bitcoin, as it can be denominated into smaller units, such as buying half or a quarter of a Bitcoin. You can buy as much or as little as you want.
